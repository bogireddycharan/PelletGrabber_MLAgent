# PelletGrabber_MLAgent
MLAgent is trained to grab golden pellets while avoiding black pellets and hitting walls.

Our Mission: Pellet Grabber
To develop an autonomous Roll a Ball game using  MLAgents from Scratch.
MLAgents is a Unity plugin for training intelligent agents in Unity environments through reinforcement learning and other machine-learning techniques.

Trained the agent over 5 million epochs to learn optimal strategies for collecting golden balls while avoiding black balls and walls.
The agent uses ray perception to perceive its environment and navigate effectively.
Created a boxed environment to simulate the game scenario, ensuring a controlled setting for training and testing.
Whenever the Agent Grabs a golden Pellet it gains positive rewards and whenever it hits a wall or collects a black pellet it gets a negative reward.
reinforcement learning techniques to enable the agent to learn from its actions and improve its performance over time.
